# Assignment 1
Implementation of Error Detection Algorithms such as CRC, VRC, LRC, and Checksum.

# Assignment 2
Implementation of Data Link layer protocols eg: Stop and Wait, Go Back N Sliding Window, and Selective Repeat Sliding Window for flow control.

# Assignment 3
Implementation of 1-persistent, non-persistent, and p-persistent CSMA techniques.

# Assignment 4
Implementation of CDMA for multiple access of a common channel by n stations. 

Each sender uses a unique code word, given by the Walsh set, to encode its data, send it across the channel, and then perfectly reconstruct the data at n stations.

# Assignment 7
Implementation of ARP, BOOTP, DHCP protocols and the corresponding mac_id lookup system.

# Assignment 8
Implementation of FTP and DNS systems.
